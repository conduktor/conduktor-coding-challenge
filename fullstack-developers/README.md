# We're hiring Fullstack Developers! üë®‚Äçüíª üë©‚Äçüíª

Don't hesitate to do the challenges presented here and tell us: jobs@conduktor.io!

We're hiring Fullstack Developers familiar with the front-ends technologies (Vue, React), and the JVM for the backends (Micronaut in Java, and another ones in Scala), with an interest for smart UI/UX.

More details: https://www.conduktor.io/jobs/

# The Challenge

## Build a customer portal

We'd like you to create a website where we could register/login, create/join teams (a team is a company, so it's private), and be able to send an invitation link to other developers for them to join my team. 

eg: I register as john@cdkt.io. I'm first one of my domain cdkt.io to register. I must create the team "cdkt" and I'll be designated as the owner. Then, I'll be able to invite my coworkers from @cdkt.io to join my "cdkt" team.

Your project will consist in 2 sub-projects:

- an API and its database (PostgreSQL)
- a front-end (Vue or React)

### I should be able to

- Register/Login with my email
- Create my team if my domain is not in the system yet
- Invite people to my team
- They can login and be a Member of my team
- As an Owner, I can remove any Member

### Tech orientation

- Do NOT use Maven
- Do NOT use Spring*. You can use Micronaut (this is what we're using for our customer API), or Scala.
- Use JDK 11+ or more. (no JDK 8)
- You can do REST API or GraphQL

### How long?

Time estimated: it depends on you!

It's really the "job" at Conduktor, just think that it's your onboarding. :-)
