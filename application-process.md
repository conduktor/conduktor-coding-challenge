# Applying at Conduktor

This document describes the Conduktor hiring process from the point of view of the candidate.

### Visiting our careers page

- All the open roles can be found at https://conduktor.io/jobs where you can apply to any desired role.

- If there isn't a role that fits, but you're still interested in working with us, you can email us at jobs@conduktor.io with your CV (or your GitHub account for developers) and a small intro of yourself.

### Screening

- We'll try our best to update you quickly. We're sorry if we don't reply in a timely manner. In any case, feel free to reach out to us at any time via jobs@conduktor.io.

- If your application receives positive feedback from our initial screen, we'll invite you to video call with the hiring manager, according to the position you're looking for.

### The first interview

This is a general discussion that can last between 15 min to 1 hour.

- This is to allow us to get to know your background and your experience, as well as allowing you to get to know Conduktor the company better. It's expected you have already done some basic research about Conduktor and has some specific questions about the role and/or the company to be expressed during the call.
  
- We may have in-depth conversation about your experience, the role within the team, how the team works and your future tasks and responsibilities.

- In all engineering roles, we will ask you to do a coding challenge after this call.

- **IMPORTANT:** All calls require a good audio quality and a working camera. You will need good internet connectivity and a good audio setup. Note that without ensuring a good setup, we will not be able to move on with the remote interview process.

### Coding Challenge (Engineering) / Assignment (Non-Engineering)

- For Non-engineering roles, candidates will usually be asked to complete an assignment or case study. In some cases this may be presented to members of the team in an interview.

- Every developer who passes the first interview should complete a coding challenge remotely.

- We are expecting the solution either in a private Github repository or in an attached .zip.

- We are reviewing the correctness of the solution, as well as its complexity and code style.

- The results are reviewed by the engineering team and feedback is given to the developer as soon as possible.

### The 2nd & 3rd interviews

- Non-engineering candidates who pass will be invited to more interviews with various members of management.

- Engineering candidates who successfully did the coding challenge will be invited to a quick interview remotely with various members of the engineering team.

- Meeting with the CEO or CTO (30min): based on their technical background or not. The purpose is to get to know the candidate better 

- This is the last step during which it's decided if the candidate will receive an offer or not.

- In the case of rejection, the candidate will be notified in the following days after the interview. This will be a constructive discussion giving the candidate as much insight as possible.

### Offer

- The offer is sent by the hiring manager, CTO or CEO, once a decision to hire has been made by the team

- The candidate has no concrete time deadline to accept/reject the offer, and we are happy to have another call to discuss any questions or doubts the candidate may have. In cases where we have a limited number of open positions for a role, and a larger number of people we'd like to make an offer to, a time limit is given.

### Diversity and Remote Working

- At Conduktor we believe that amazing talent should not be constrained by physical barriers, and we exhaust all avenues to hire the best candidates regardless of their location. Our multinational and multicultural team shares a culture of openness and excellence and passion for programming.

- At the moment, we are in more than 6 different countries working closely together all remotely!

- In specific cases, such as sales roles covering a particular region, there may be a requirement for candidates to be based in a specific location for operational reasons.
