# The Challenge

Conduktor is a software company centered around Apache Kafka.

## Business requirements: a mini-Conduktor API

Write an API to:

- Connect to an Apache Kafka cluster
- List its topics with metadata
- Consume records from its topics in *real-time*
  - Consider adding some options like filters, start from etc.

### Technical requirements

- Use Scala/ZIO/http4s
- You can use Caliban if you know GraphQL
- Write tests for your API (need to make sure it works)
- Apache Kafka: Do NOT use consumer groups but custom partition assignments (no group id should be used)
- Only sbt

### How long?

Time estimated: it depends on you!

It's really the "job" at Conduktor, just think that it's your onboarding. :-)
